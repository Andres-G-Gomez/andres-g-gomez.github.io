In this project, we conduct a comparative study of four prominent machine learning algorithms — Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF) — tailored for text classification on the Open Software Development Governance - Code Dataset (OSDG-CD). Additionally, we identified the key words corresponding to each class. We also compared our results with other models such as BERT and Label Powerset with SVM, and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of these models in the [{{ page.pdf_link_text }}]({{ page.pdf_file_path | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}.

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 broad goals that seek to address some of the world's most urgent economic, social, and environmental issues. Achieving these goals requires a joint effort from governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector. With vast amounts of data being generated by the United Nations and outside organizations daily, automatic systems that utilize machine learning and natural language processing can dramatically reduce the time is takes to track the progress made in achieving the SDGs. This work underscores the potential of text classification and keyword identification techniques in accelerating the analysis of UN documents related to the SDGs. These methods can effectively allow for improved monitoring of the progress made towards meeting the SDGs and contribute towards the goal of a more sustainable future.

The Open Software Development Governance - Code Dataset (OSDG-CD) contains over 30,000 text excerpts gathered by thousands of volunteers from a majority of the UN Member States. The excerpts are of paragraph length and are derived from publicly available documents [1]. Roughly 3,000 of these documents are from UN-related sources. These documents are labeled (i.e. have associated SDGs) and are roughly 90 words in length. The class label of each excerpt was reviewed by up to 9 domain experts and each expert was tasked with casting a vote on whether or not they agreed with the assigned class label. The individual votes are included, along with an agreement metric that combines the consensus among domain experts.

This work evaluates the text classification performance of MNB, SVM, LR, and RF, focusing on overall accuracies and top-3 accuracies. NLP feature extraction techniques, specifically TF-IDF and count vectorizer, are compared, with TF-IDF chosen for its ability to provide more generalizable features. Hyperparameter tuning covers alphas, C values, max depth, and min_df for TF-IDF, MNB, SVM, LR, and RF. Three cases of training data are assessed, considering equal sample weights, agreement as a feature, and weighing samples by agreement. The paper concludes with insights into the optimal hyperparameters for each algorithm.

In Table 1, we see that SVM obtained the highest validation accuracy, followed closely by LR. We are unable to obtain a top 3 accuracy for SVM because it lacks a probabilistic interpretation. Of MNB, LR, and RF, LR had the highest top 3 accuracy on the validation set. In Table 2, we can observe the generalization of each model to the test set. LR obtained both the highest overall accuracy and top 3 accuracy on the test set. It is important to observe the top k accuracies because some of the SDGs are quite intertwined.

In Table 3, we show the Precision, Recall, and F1-score for the LR model evaluated on the test set. We see that the model very well on SDG 3 and quite poorly on SDG 8 and 10, as observed by the F1-score. The model obtains the lowest precision for SDG 8. 

The second task involved determining the key words for each class. In this dataset, we are provided documents for 15 different SDGs. Keyword extraction allows us to identify the most important words or phrases in a corpus. By separating the documents into their respective classes and implementing TF-IDF, we were able to identify the keywords for each class. We listed the top 20 words for each class within the paper.
