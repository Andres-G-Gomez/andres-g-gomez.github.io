I am currently a graduate student at the University of Florida. I am studying electrical and computer engineering, with a focus in machine learning. Additionally, I am working in [Dr. Wei Shao's](https://nephrology.medicine.ufl.edu/profile/shao-wei-1/) Artificial Intelligence and Medical Image Analysis Laboratory. Here, I apply deep learning methods to medical images for segmentation and disease classification purposes. 

My project centers on refining deep learning techniques for multi-object medical image segmentation. Specifically, I am working on optimizing vision models using methods like image augmentation, layer freezing, and fine tuning to analyze computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging datasets. I also run large scale experiments benchmarking recently published models against state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. 

I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's as public as possible. I will soon be posting articles outlining resources I found helpful for learning machine/deep learning. Additionally, I will soon post tutorials, videos, and articles that I created to more thoroughly explain the intricacies of new segmentation models and how apply them. They will likely appear on this site.
