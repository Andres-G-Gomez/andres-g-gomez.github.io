I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Blue Ridge Envisioneering, specializing in applying transformer-based models for time-series analysis and optimizing object detection algorithms for edge devices. I hold an MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Florida, where I focused on signal/image processing and machine learning, complemented by research in computer vision.  

Previously, I collaborated with [Dr. Catia Silva](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/catia-silva/bio/) to develop a personalized, affect-aware multimodal educational assessment tool that integrated computer vision and time-series algorithms to analyze localized facial expressions, enhancing model adaptability. Prior to that, I conducted research in [Dr. Wei Shao's](https://nephrology.medicine.ufl.edu/profile/shao-wei-1/) AI in Medical Image Analysis Lab, where I engineered a novel deformable down-sampling module to improve the adaptability and performance of leading computer vision architectures and optimized deep learning models for multi-object medical image segmentation, benchmarking them against state-of-the-art methods.
