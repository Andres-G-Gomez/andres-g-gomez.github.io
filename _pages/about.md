I am currently a master's student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department at the University of Florida. My academic pursuits have centered on signal/image processing and machine learning coursework, complemented by research endeavors in computer vision. Additionally, I am working in [Dr. Wei Shao's](https://nephrology.medicine.ufl.edu/profile/shao-wei-1/) Artificial Intelligence in Medical Image Analysis Laboratory. Here, I apply deep learning methods to medical images for segmentation and disease classification purposes. 

My project centers on refining deep learning techniques for multi-object medical image segmentation. Specifically, I am working on optimizing vision models using methods like image augmentation, layer freezing, and fine tuning to analyze computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging datasets. I also run large scale experiments benchmarking recently published models against state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. 

I am also working with [Dr. Catia Silva](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/catia-silva/bio/) to build out a personalized, affect-aware multimodal educational assessment tool. This project integrates computer vision and time-series algorithms to advance learning technologies, with a specific focus on leveraging localized facial expressions for enhanced adaptability and expressiveness. This surpasses previous methodologies , which often classify emotions into a limited set, thereby constraining the model's flexibility. 

I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's as public as possible. On my projects page, you'll find a collection of tutorials and articles that I've written to provide a comprehensive explanation of the intricacies of new segmentation models.
