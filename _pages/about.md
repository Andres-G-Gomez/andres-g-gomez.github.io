I am currently a graduate student at the University of Florida. I am studying electrical and computer engineering, with a focus in machine learning. Additionally, I am working in [Dr. Wei Shao's](https://nephrology.medicine.ufl.edu/profile/shao-wei-1/) Artificial Intelligence and Medical Image Analysis Laboratory. Here, I apply deep learning methods to medical images for segmentation and disease classification purposes. Future projects will be in the space of multi-modal image registration, multi-organ image segmentation, and/or discovery of imaging biomarkers for disease diagnosis. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-gomez-7410a8160). 

I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's as public as possible. I will soon be writing articles outlining resources I found helpful in my journey of learning machine/deep learning. They will likely appear on this site.
